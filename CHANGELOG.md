# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Entries are proposed by the AI assistant at the end of a session and written
only after human approval (see the `changelog` instruction section and the
`changelog-nudge` hook).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Change Log workflow: `changelog-nudge` Stop hook + a `changelog` section in
  `template.md` (`INC_CHANGELOG`). At session end the agent proposes a Change Log
  entry and requires human approval before writing it.
- Session-lifecycle hooks: `precompact-archive` (archives the raw transcript
  before context compaction) and `log-session-end` (writes a `SessionEnd`
  record); both Claude-only, surfaced via `audit.sh`.

### Changed
- `install-hooks.sh` wires the new Stop/PreCompact/SessionEnd hooks; `customize.sh`,
  `my-context.env.example`, and the examples updated for the new section.
