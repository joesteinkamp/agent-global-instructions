# The full guide

Everything beyond the [README](../README.md) quick start: how the render works,
every command, hook, and permission layer, and how to customize the wording.

## How it works

Three layers — a shared baseline, your personal answers, and the generated
output:

```
template.md       wording + which sections to include     (shared, committed)
      +
team-context.env  a team's shared answer baseline         (optional, committed by a fork)
my-context.env    your answers: name, env, autonomy …     (personal, gitignored — overrides team)
extras.local.md   personal sections spliced in verbatim   (personal, gitignored)
      │
      ▼   ./customize.sh
rendered files    CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md       (snapshots — generated)
```

**The rendered files are snapshots — never edit them directly.** Anything you
change there is overwritten on the next render. To change the output, edit
`template.md` (wording, which sections), `my-context.env` (your answers), or
`extras.local.md` (personal sections the shared template can't express — e.g.
machine-specific serving notes; spliced in after the "Output artifacts"
section). Re-run `./customize.sh` and every personal layer survives.

## The parts

Independent parts — use any subset; `./install.sh` wires them all:

1. **Instructions** (model-facing) — a customizable `template.md` rendered into
   per-tool instruction files. *Advice* the assistant should follow.
2. **Commands** — slash-command shortcuts (`/ship`, `/sync`, `/worktrees`,
   `/improve`, `/verify`, `/ux-audit`) for repeatable
   workflows.
3. **Guardrails & observability** (hooks) — auto-format, block edits to
   generated/sensitive paths, trip on catastrophic shell, log every tool call to
   JSONL, and surface your memory stores at session start. *Enforcement* the
   model can't skip.
4. **Validation & verification** — two complementary passes: a multi-role review
   team for *taste* (`/improve`, "could it be better?") and an evidence-based
   *verification* pass (`/verify`, "is it correct & true to spec?") that runs the
   change, drives it in a browser, and checks it against your project briefs —
   each with a Stop hook that nudges you.
5. **Settings** (per tool) — a client-enforced permissions layer mapped to each
   tool's native model (Claude & Cursor deny rules, Codex sandbox + approval,
   Gemini Policy Engine) that backs up the guard hooks with rules the model
   can't bypass.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `template.md` | Source of truth for the instructions. Wording + `{{vars}}` + toggleable `<!--SECTION:x-->` blocks. |
| `customize.sh` | Asks a handful of questions (or reads `my-context.env`), fills the template, writes the finalized file(s). Also `--scan-mcp`. |
| `my-context.env.example` | Copy to `my-context.env` (gitignored) to save your answers. |
| `team-context.env` | Optional, committed by a team fork — shared answer baseline loaded before `my-context.env` (personal values win key by key). |
| `extras.local.md` | Optional, gitignored — personal Markdown sections spliced verbatim into every render at `{{EXTRAS}}`. |
| `examples/` | Two finished sample renders + the `.env` inputs that reproduce them. |
| `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` | One-shot installer for every layer, and its clean reverse (configs backed up; instruction files left in place). |
| `commands/` + `render-commands.sh` + `install-commands.sh` | Canonical commands (`commands/*.md`) → `render-commands.sh` generates per-tool ports (`commands/{codex,cursor,gemini}/`, gitignored — regenerated on every install) → `install-commands.sh` installs Claude/Cursor/Gemini commands and Codex skills (`~/.codex/skills/`). |
| `.agents/skills/` (+ `.claude/skills/` symlinks) + `skills-lock.json` | Third-party Skills vendored via [`npx skills`](https://skills.sh), project-scoped so they ship with the repo. `.agents/skills/` is the canonical Agent-Skills-standard tree (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI); `.claude/skills/` entries are symlinks into it, so Claude Code reads the same bytes. Currently: `grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` plus their primitives `grilling` and `domain-modeling`, and `ux-audit` (from [joesteinkamp/ux-audit-skill](https://github.com/joesteinkamp/ux-audit-skill); skill-backed — `install-commands.sh` symlinks it globally for Claude/Codex in place of the `/ux-audit` wrapper). Re-sync with `npx skills update`; the lockfile pins each skill's upstream source + hash. `grill-me` is also promoted to a globally-installed command (see `commands/grill-me.md` below) so `/grill-me` works in any project, not just this repo's checkout. |
| `hooks/` + `install-hooks.sh` | Guardrail + observability hooks → merged into each tool's config (Claude / Codex / Cursor / Gemini). |
| `*-permissions.snippet.*` + `policies/` + `install-settings.sh` | Per-tool permissions: Claude & Cursor `deny` JSON, Codex `config.toml` sandbox+approval, Gemini Policy Engine rules (idempotent, backed up). |
| `audit.sh` | Read back the tool-call audit log — timeline, stats, or live tail. |
| `converge.sh` | Daemon for the `/worktrees` flow: folds parallel agent branches (`ai/*`) into the integration branch as they advance. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Human-readable log of AI-made changes — proposed by the assistant at session end, written only after you approve. `customize.sh --global` seeds a copy into `~/.claude/` (seed-only; never overwrites). |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI: shellcheck every script + run `test.sh` on push / PR. |
| `test.sh` | Smoke tests: render engine, the `load_env` parser, example reproducibility, and installer/uninstaller smoke tests. |

Rendered output (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`), your `my-context.env`,
`extras.local.md`, `mcp-rules.local`, the generated command ports, and the
`verify/` + `audits/` artifacts are **gitignored** — they're personal or
generated; produce them locally. Want to see finished output first? Read
[`examples/aggressive-tailscale.md`](../examples/aggressive-tailscale.md)
(aggressive autonomy, Tailscale serving, all sections on) or
[`examples/balanced-local.md`](../examples/balanced-local.md) (balanced
autonomy, local serving, improve + tools + worktrees off).

## 1. The instruction set

`customize.sh` asks (or reads from `my-context.env`):

- **Who you are** — name, pronouns, role, timezone.
- **How you preview/test web & HTML work** — Tailscale, local, or none. The
  HTML-artifact preference stays either way; only the *serving* method changes.

Then it offers the **recommended setup** (every section on, aggressive
autonomy) — press Enter and you're done. Choose "customize" instead to walk
every option:

- **About you** — what you care about; your environment (asked, never assumed).
- **How you like work done** — autonomy posture (aggressive/balanced); whether
  to encourage agent teams (and which roles); subagents for long work.
- **Where your memory lives** — a local file/db store (e.g. Hermes at
  `~/.hermes/`), a notes app over MCP (e.g. Notion, Obsidian), both, or
  generic. Set non-interactively with `MEM_KIND` + `MEM_PATH` / `MEM_TOOL` (or
  override the bullets via `MEM_BLOCK`).
- **Which sections to include** — memory-OS discovery, agent teams,
  improve-after-larger-changes, tools & MCP servers, output artifacts,
  **design system & UI** (build to the tokens, stay on the scales, WCAG AA,
  honor reduced-motion — **on by default for everyone**; set `INC_DESIGN=n` to
  opt out), project-specific instructions, docs-first, correction capture,
  change log.

## 2. Commands

Portable prompt shortcuts. `commands/*.md` is the **single source of truth**
(Claude dialect). `./render-commands.sh` translates each into the other tools'
dialects under `commands/{codex,cursor,gemini}/` — per-tool frontmatter, argument
tokens (`$ARGUMENTS` → `{{args}}` for Gemini), and shell-injection (`` !`cmd` ``
→ `!{cmd}` for Gemini, → "run `cmd`" for Codex/Cursor). Those ports are
**generated and gitignored** — `./install-commands.sh` re-renders on every run.
`./install-commands.sh [tool ...]` installs each into the right place — Claude
`~/.claude/commands/`, Codex skills under `~/.codex/skills/` (invoked
`$<name>`), Cursor `~/.cursor/commands/`, Gemini `~/.gemini/commands/`
(`.toml`). Add a command once as `commands/<name>.md` and all four tools pick
it up.

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `/ship` | Tidy gate (format/lint/test, stop if broken) → stage → commit → push, and on a feature branch open + **merge** the PR/MR (squash, delete branch), then return to default. Works with GitHub (`gh`) or GitLab (`glab`). The all-in-one. |
| `/sync` | Fetch + rebase the current branch on the latest default branch. |
| `/worktrees` | One worktree per parallel agent (`ai/<agent>`), converged into a single integration tree a lone dev server watches — several models, near-live. Pairs with `converge.sh`. |
| `/grill-me` | A relentless interview to sharpen a plan or design before you build it — one question at a time, recommended answers offered, environment facts looked up rather than asked, nothing acted on until we reach a shared understanding. |
| `/improve` | Spin up a multi-role review team on the recent diff (architect, back-end, front-end, +UI/UX) for prioritized improvement opportunities. |
| `/verify` | Prove the change is correct & true to spec — build/test, drive the route in a headless browser (responsive screenshots, console/a11y gates, visual regression), and check it against the project briefs (PRODUCT/DESIGN/CODE.md). Writes a served HTML report. |
| `/ux-audit` | *(design group, skill-backed)* UX audit **from a screenshot**. The full [`ux-audit`](https://github.com/joesteinkamp/ux-audit-skill) skill is vendored at `.agents/skills/ux-audit` and symlinked into `~/.claude/skills` + `~/.codex/skills` at install — Claude/Codex run the real engine (15 heuristic frameworks, 0–100 scores, annotated screenshots); Cursor/Gemini get the wrapper command's inline rubric. Writes + serves a self-contained HTML report. |

**Command groups.** A command declares `group: <name>` in its frontmatter
(absent ⇒ `core`, always installed). The **`design`** group
(`/ux-audit`) installs **by default for everyone** — everyone should design
better; `--no-design` (or `INC_DESIGN=n`) forces it off and prunes any already
installed, so opting out self-heals. The design pack composes with the
external [project-starter-pack](https://github.com/joesteinkamp/project-starter-pack)
(briefs + `DESIGN.json`); the
[ux-audit skill](https://github.com/joesteinkamp/ux-audit-skill) itself is
**vendored in-repo** at `.agents/skills/ux-audit` (pinned in
`skills-lock.json`; re-sync with `npx skills update`) and this repo is its
installer — `install-commands.sh` symlinks it into `~/.claude/skills` and
`~/.codex/skills`, while Cursor/Gemini get the `/ux-audit` wrapper command
(no skill support there).

**Improving the ux-audit skill — one-way sync.** The skill is a **separate
project** developed in its own working checkout of the GitHub repo (e.g.
`~/projects/ux-audit-skill`); that checkout is not part of this harness and
nothing here reads from it. Improvements are made there and **pushed to
GitHub**; this repo then pulls the released state with `npx skills update`
(hash-pinned in `skills-lock.json`). Never edit `.agents/skills/ux-audit/`
in place — it's a synced vendor copy and the next update overwrites it.

## 3. Guardrails & observability (hooks)

One set of scripts serves **Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini (CLI), and
Antigravity** — a `HOOK_PLATFORM` env var (set by the installer) makes each block
in the right dialect (exit-2 for Claude/Codex, `{"decision":"deny"}` for Gemini,
`{"permission":"deny"}` for Cursor, `{"allow_tool":false,"deny_reason":…}`+exit-0
for Antigravity). `./install-hooks.sh [claude|codex|cursor|gemini|antigravity]`
merges them into each tool's config (idempotent, backs up first). Codex surfaces
file edits via `apply_patch`, so path-guard + auto-format are wired there too;
Cursor has no blocking pre-edit event, so its write-protection comes from the
permissions layer while the hook guards secret *reads*. **Antigravity** is a
separate tool from the Gemini CLI with its own hooks schema — it's **opt-in**
(`./install-hooks.sh antigravity`), not in the default set. Full detail in
[`hooks/README.md`](../hooks/README.md).

| Hook | Fires | Does |
|------|-------|------|
| `guard-paths` | before edits | Block edits to `build/ dist/ .next/ node_modules/ .git/`, `.env*`, lockfiles (resolves `..`/symlinks first). |
| `guard-bash` | before shell | Trip on catastrophic `rm -r` (root/home/parent) and force-pushes. Best-effort tripwire, not a sandbox. |
| `format-edited` | after edits | Auto-format the edited file with the project's Prettier/ESLint. |
| `log-tool` | every tool call | **Observability** — append one JSONL record per tool event (secrets redacted, log is `0600`). |
| `improve-nudge` | turn end | When a turn ends with a large diff, nudge you to run `/improve` (once per distinct diff). |
| `verify-nudge` | turn end | When a turn ends with a UI/route change and no fresh `verify/` report, nudge you to run `/verify` (self-silences once verified). |
| `changelog-nudge` | turn end | When a session ends with changes, remind you to **propose a Change Log entry and approve it before it's written** (never auto-writes). |
| `load-memory` | session start | Surface your out-of-tool memory stores (Hermes `~/.hermes/`, OpenClaw, project `MEMORY.md`/`memory/`) so the agent reads them first. Claude + Cursor; silent when none exist. |
| `precompact-archive` | before compaction | Archive the raw transcript to `~/.ai-logs/transcripts/` before Claude compacts, plus a `PreCompact` audit record. Claude only; never blocks. |
| `log-session-end` | session end | Append a `SessionEnd` record (with the end reason) to the audit log, closing the trail. Claude only. |

Read the audit trail with `./audit.sh` (`--stats`, `--follow`, `-n N`). The log
lives at `~/.ai-logs/tool-calls.jsonl` (`$AI_TOOL_LOG`); set `AI_LOG_RESPONSES=0`
to drop tool responses.

### Permissions (client-enforced, per tool)

The guard hooks are a best-effort tripwire. `./install-settings.sh [tool ...]`
adds the **client-enforced** half, mapped to each tool's native model:

- **Claude** — a `permissions` block in `~/.claude/settings.json` whose `deny`
  rules (mirroring `guard-paths` — `.env*`, lockfiles, `build/ dist/
  node_modules/ .git/`) the model can't bypass, plus an `ask` gate (`sudo`).
  Tune via `settings-permissions.snippet.json`.
- **Cursor** — the same `deny` set in `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` (the CLI agent;
  the GUI agent is allowlist-only, so there the read-guard hook is the net).
  Tune via `settings-permissions.cursor.snippet.json`.
- **Codex** — `approval_policy = "on-request"` + `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`
  in `~/.codex/config.toml` (a managed, sentinel-delimited block; skipped if you
  already set those keys). Codex's sandbox is directory-scoped, so fine-grained
  path-deny stays with the `guard-paths` hook. Tune via `codex-permissions.snippet.toml`.
- **Gemini** — Policy Engine `deny`/`ask_user` rules dropped at
  `~/.gemini/policies/gemini-guardrails.toml`, plus `folderTrust` enabled.

Merges are idempotent and backed up; `./uninstall.sh` removes exactly these.

## 4. Validation & verification

Two passes, deliberately different. **`/improve` is opinion** — "could this be
better?" — it reasons about the diff and needs no ground truth. **`/verify` is
evidence** — "is it correct & true to spec?" — it runs the change, drives it, and
diffs it against the design and the briefs, and it can *fail*. They compose:
verify proves it's right, improve asks whether it's good (verify first — no
point polishing a change that doesn't render).

- **`/improve`** spins up parallel subagents — technical architect, back-end,
  front-end, and a UI/UX lens when UI changed — each returning concrete,
  prioritized fixes with `file:line`, then deduped into one summary.
- **`/verify`** runs a lens stack, each emitting **PASS / FAIL / N/A** with
  evidence: ① builds & runs (detects the project's tooling); ② renders in a headless
  browser (Playwright) — responsive screenshots, console & network gates,
  axe-core a11y; ③ visual regression vs the last run or the default branch;
  ④ matches the design (Figma via MCP, or `DESIGN.md` + `DESIGN.json` tokens);
  ⑤ conforms to the briefs (`PRODUCT.md`/`DESIGN.md`/`CODE.md` + guardrails —
  pairs with the [project-starter-pack](https://github.com/joesteinkamp/project-starter-pack));
  ⑥ does what it claimed (re-runs the PR/task acceptance criteria). It writes a
  self-contained `verify/<slug>-<date>/report.html` and serves it over your
  preview method — verdict + link inline, findings in the artifact.
- **`improve-nudge`** / **`verify-nudge`** (Stop hooks — Claude, Codex, Cursor)
  remind you to run each pass when a turn ends with a qualifying diff
  (`IMPROVE_MIN_FILES`/`IMPROVE_MIN_LINES`, `VERIFY_UI_RE`), once per distinct
  diff.

## Customize the wording

Edit `template.md` and re-run `customize.sh`.

- **Add an optional block:** wrap it in `<!--SECTION:name-->` …
  `<!--/SECTION:name-->` (one marker per line) and add a matching `keep` toggle
  in `customize.sh`'s `render()`. `test.sh` asserts every section is wired in.
- **Add an inline `{{VAR}}`:** reference it in the template and add its name to
  the `SUBST_VARS` list near the top of `customize.sh` (that one list drives the
  value passthrough and the substitution). Add it to `my-context.env.example`
  too if users should set it.
- **Add a multi-line block var** (like `{{MEMORY_PATHS}}` / `{{MCP_RULES}}` /
  `{{EXTRAS}}`): put the placeholder alone on its own line and handle it with a
  `line == "{{X}}"` branch in `render()`, not `SUBST_VARS`.

Run `./test.sh` after any change.

## The machine-wide layout

`customize.sh --global` (run by `install.sh`) renders **one** file,
`~/AGENTS.md`, and points each tool at it:

- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` are **symlinks** — those
  tools only ever read their file.
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is a small **real file** containing `@~/AGENTS.md`
  (Claude Code's documented import syntax) — not a symlink, because Claude
  appends `#` memories and `/memory` edits to this file; through a symlink
  those writes would mutate the shared `~/AGENTS.md` and be wiped by the next
  render. Anything you (or Claude) add below the import line survives
  re-renders untouched. Claude Code shows a one-time approval prompt per
  project for the external import — accept it.

`uninstall.sh` reverses the pointers: each is restored from its newest backup
(taken when the pointer was first installed), or removed if none exists;
`~/AGENTS.md` itself is left in place.

## Notes

- `my-context.env` (and `team-context.env`) are **parsed, not executed** — only
  known `KEY=VALUE` keys are read (no sourcing), so a stray command in them
  can't run. Values may be single/double quoted and span multiple quoted lines.
- **Precedence:** explicit shell environment variables outrank both context
  files (`INC_DESIGN=n ./customize.sh` wins over a file value), and
  `my-context.env` outranks `team-context.env` key by key.
- Renders and config merges are **atomic** (temp file + move) and back up an
  existing file before overwriting (keeping the 5 newest backups).
- The hooks are a **best-effort safety net, not a security boundary** — they see
  a tool's structured input and match heuristically. See `hooks/README.md`.
- Runs on **bash 3.2+**, so macOS' stock `/bin/bash` works. `jq` is required
  for the hook and settings installers.
